2Performant PHP App Skeleton
============================

This is the PHP Skeleton for a 2Performant App that works via OAuth and is compatible with the 2Performant App Store (http://apps.2performant.com).


Installation
============

In order to use this app you need MySQL.

1) Go to http://apps.2performant.com and create a developer account. Once you do that create your first application.

2) At the Integration URLs section fill in the addresses where the script is located.
   * Init URL is init.php
   * Support URL is support.php
   * Embed URL is embed.php

3) Import the mysql table in the DB.
   $ mysql your_db < db.sql

4) Add your settings in config.php.  
   * $KEY, $SECRET are given to you when you create a new app at http://apps.2performant.com.
   * $CALLBACK is the OAuth location where we will redirect the user after authorization.
   * $DB contains the database settings.


After these steps are complete add the application to the 2Performant Sandbox (on the app page option 'add to sandbox'). You need an account there if you don't have one previously.
